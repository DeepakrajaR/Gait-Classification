Research Study of Autism using Kinetics, Kinematics, and Temporal_Spatial gait data collected from a laboratory setup using the Vicon motion capture system.
This study aims to diagnose any physical impairment symptoms at a very early stage to equip medical experts with detailed reports helpful for further treatment.


Dataset:
* Kinetics_autism.xlsx
* Kinematics_autism.xlsx

The above-mentioned files are attached to this repository. Those are the data sets used for the research.

The 'gait_data_collection_pipeline.py' file contains the Python code to generate an image that visualizes the steps involved in data collection. I have also attached the image in the repository.
